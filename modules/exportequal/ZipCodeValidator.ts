/**
 * Both CommonJS and AMD generally have the concept of an exports object which contains all exports from a module.

They also support replacing the exports object with a custom single object. Default exports are meant to act as a replacement for this behavior; however, the two are incompatible. TypeScript supports export = to model the traditional CommonJS and AMD workflow.

The export = syntax specifies a single object that is exported from the module. This can be a class, interface, namespace, function, or enum.

When importing a module using export =, TypeScript-specific import let = require("module") must be used to import the module.
