Often you will need to extend functionality on a module. A common JS pattern is to augment the original object with extensions, similar to how JQuery extensions work. As weâ€™ve mentioned before, modules do not merge like global namespace objects would. The recommended solution is to not mutate the original object, but rather export a new entity that provides the new functionality.

Consider a simple calculator implementation defined in module Calculator.ts. The module also exports a helper function to test the calculator functionality by passing a list of input strings and writing the result at the end.
